"Templating is a method of generating HTML pages by combining static "
"templates with variable data. The template files contain the static parts of"
" the desired HTML output and include special syntax describing how variable "
"content will be inserted. For example, this can be used to insert the "
"current date in the footer of each page, or to surround the main content of "
"the document with a scaffold of HTML for layout and formatting purposes. "
"Doing so only requires an understanding of HTML and the templating syntax. "
"Knowledge of Python can be helpful, but is not required."

"Templating uses an inheritance mechanism which allows child templates files "
"(e.g. in a theme) to override as much (or as little) of their 'parents' as "
"desired. Likewise, content authors can use their own local templates to "
"override as much (or as little) of the theme templates as desired."
